				The Kern River Valley is a place of fun and adventure. Those who travel
				beyond the campgrounds and common attractions won't go far without discovering
				something of interest, whether it be amazing scenery in the mountains around
				the Valley, an excellent fishing spot that isn't easily accessible, or a trail
				that leads to an all-but-forgotten area with history to discover.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those looking for a more scheduled and relaxing time will still find plenty
				to enjoy, from rafting and fishing to bars and dining. Nature and civilization
				are never far away.

				The Kern River is the namesake of the Valley, and for good reason. Fed by
				snow-melt near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Whitney" rel="noopener noreferrer external">Mount Whitney</a>
				and running for over 160 miles, the Kern River is popular for both rafting
				and kayaking.
			</p>
			<p>
				During the Summer months, the Kern River attracts rafters from around the
				world &mdash; both tourists and professionals.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are several <a href="https://rafting.kernvalley.us">rafting companies</a>
				littered along the Kern River who offer guided trips as well as rentals
				and other equipment.

				With so much nature surrounding small towns, hiking can be done year-round
				and usually without having to drive more than a few minutes from any of
				the towns. You cannot drive from one place to another without coming across
				a trail that would take you to a scenic location, somewhere like an old
				mining camp or what remains of an abandoned town, or just a path to follow
				while spending the day getting lost to find yourself.

				or nowhere in particular, wandering around is guaranteed to satisfy that itch
				for adventure if you're just willing to place one foot in front of the
				other enough times.
